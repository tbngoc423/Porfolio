# ðŸ“Š **Data Analysis Report - The Look Ecommerce Project**

## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Overview of the Project**
**The Look Ecommerce** is a **simulated e-commerce dataset** in the fashion industry, designed for research and data analysis practice. The data is synthetically generated to mimic an online retail platform's structure, helping analysts explore shopping trends, optimize business strategies, and evaluate operational performance.

### **Project Objectives:**
- Build a **data model** for a simulated e-commerce platform.
- Analyze **customer behavior** and optimize key business metrics.
- Create **data visualizations** and dashboards to support decision-making.

## **3. System Overview & Business Processes**
### **3.1 Simulated System**
The system in this project is a **simulation** of an e-commerce platform. The data is **not** collected from a real system but is **synthetically generated** to represent common business processes in online retail.

This system simulation includes:
- **User registration and login**
- **Product search and order placement**
- **Cart management and payment processing**
- **Order fulfillment and return management**

### **3.2 Business Process Flow**
The following **business processes** are designed to represent a simulated online retail store.

#### **ðŸ“Œ Order Processing Flow**
1. User **logs into the system**.
2. Searches for products and **adds them to the cart**.
3. Selects a **payment method** (credit card, bank transfer, COD).
4. **Confirms the order** and generates a **simulated invoice**.
5. Order is **shipped and delivery is confirmed**.

#### **ðŸ“Œ Shipping Process**
1. Order is **processed** and handed over to a **simulated shipping partner**.
2. **Delivery status** is updated in the system.
3. Customer **receives the package**, confirms delivery, or requests a return.

#### **ðŸ“Œ Return & Refund Process**
1. Customers can **request a return** due to product issues or dissatisfaction.
2. The system updates the **return status** and processes the **refund**.
3. Return data is stored for **further analysis**.

## **4. Data Flow**
### **4.1 Key Data Components**
The dataset consists of **five major components**:

1. **Product Management** - Stores product details, pricing, and inventory.
2. **Payment Processing** - Records transaction details and payment methods.
3. **Order Management** - Tracks order status from placement to delivery.
4. **User Interaction Tracking** - Logs product views, searches, and clicks.
5. **Shipping Management** - Records delivery updates and return processing.

## **5. Data Analysis Requirements**
To support business decision-making, the project focuses on three main types of reports:

### **ðŸ“Š 5.1 Business Performance Reports**
- **Total revenue** over time, by region, and by product category.
- **Gross profit** and **profit margin analysis**.

### **ðŸ“Š 5.2 Order & Shipping Reports**
- **Order volume trends** over time.
- **Cancellation and return rates**.
- **Average delivery time analysis**.

### **ðŸ“Š 5.3 User Interaction Reports**
- **Website traffic and user engagement trends**.
- **Search behavior and product interactions**.

## **7. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
The database schema is designed following an **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) model**, simulating how data would be structured in a real e-commerce system.

Main entities include:
- **Users** â€“ Simulated user information.
- **Orders & Order Items** â€“ Order tracking data.
- **Products & Inventory** â€“ Product details and stock levels.
- **Events** â€“ Logs of customer interactions.
